        <p class="uppercase"><strong>Riverside Aquettes was founded in 1958 and became a non-profit corporation in 1966. We are one of the oldest synchronized swimming clubs in the United States.</strong></p>
        <p>Sue Nesbitt, our head coach, is an internationally renowned swim coach. Many of our girls have gone on to the Olympics. RAQ has been producing high-caliber and goal-oriented young people for may years. We use synchronized swimming to develop technical, physical and mental ability, integrating creative movement to music and working as a team member.</p>

        <p class="uppercase"><strong>This class offers techniques to develop muscular flexibility, strength and endurance while in the water. We do lots of variety with steady state cardio, intervals, pyramids, and circuit training during the week.</strong></p>
        <p>We have lots of toys to play with which will increase your intensity. The best part is, we have fun. We play hard, but have plenty of time to meet people and enjoy each other's com- pany. We have quarterly luncheons for extra time together. Come have fun and get a great workout. The pool is heated. There is a shallow end if you would like to keep your feet closer to the ground. It helps if you are comfortable in the water, but swimming ability is not necessary. A lift is available.</p>
